dbling: The Chrome OS Forensic Tool
===================================

|docs| |python_versions| |license_type|

dbling is a tool for performing forensics in Chrome OS.

Please view the latest version of the documentation on `Read the Docs`_ and the latest version of the code on `GitHub`_.

dbling Components
-----------------

dbling is divided into the following main components:

Crawler
~~~~~~~

The Crawler finds and downloads the list of the currently-available extensions on the Chrome Web Store, determines which
extensions are at a version that has already been downloaded, downloads those that have not yet been downloaded, and
adds information on the newly downloaded extensions to the database.

The documentation for the Crawler code is under `crawl`.


Template Generator
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Template Generator runs concurrently with the Crawler. For each new extension downloaded by the Crawler, the
Template Generator calculates the centroid of the extension and stores it in the database. The Template Generator does
not run inside Chrome or Chrome OS, and so it does not use the same mechanisms for unpacking and installing that Chrome
does natively. Instead, the primary function of the Template Generator is to mimic as closely as possible the Chrome's
functions as they pertain to unpacking and installing extensions.

The code for the Template Generator is implemented alongside the Crawler, but the main function that creates templates
is :func:`~common.centroid.calc_centroid`.


Profiler
~~~~~~~~

The Profiler is a command line tool designed for use by forensic examiners to create profiles of the extensions
installed on a disk image. This is the piece of code that uses the information about Chrome OS's disk and file system
layout to identify the most likely encrypted directories to contain installed extensions. It then leverages the MERL
Exporter to interpret the results against the database of extension templates and store them to a MERL file.

The documentation for the Profiler code is under :doc:`profile`.


MERL Exporter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MERL Exporter creates a MERL file based on a set of information on extension candidates. The MERL Exporter is used
directly by the Profiler to query the database of extension fingerprints (originally created by the Template Generator)
for matching extension profiles and filters them using a set of given criteria. It then saves the results of the profile
search by translating the results into XML entries that conform to the MERL schema.

The documentation for the MERL Exporter code is under :doc:`merl`.


Gripper
~~~~~~~

Gripper leverages the APIs provided by G Suite to acquire data about a user's activities on a Chromebook. Specifically,
Gripper answers the following questions:

- Who was logged into a specific device?
- When were they logged in?
- What did they do while logged in?

For more information about Gripper, see :doc:`google/index`. The documentation for the Gripper code is under
:doc:`google/apis`.
